Well, I'm really making a go of it.  I thought coding would be a little easier, but there are 
so many goddamn moving pieces you really can't effectively accomplish anything without knowing 
a little something about most everything the code could possibly interact with...

So, I dunno...stick with refining skills using JS?  Or keep trying to go down the Python 
rabbit hole?  Conundrum...

One, I know my way around HTML and CSS a bit... I can spin up static pages without issue, and 
build out some dynamics into them.  But I'm at a dead stop when approaching that idea with 
Python.  At least I know how to link a script in HTML....

JavaScript?  Python?  Both?  Just start poring through libraries and learning from them?

I just don't know....
